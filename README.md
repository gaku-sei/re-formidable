## Formidable

_This library is not ready for prime time yet, and both its API and its implementation might change in the near future_

A library that allows you to build forms simply _and_ safely.

See [Bs-Optic](https://github.com/scoville/bs-optic) for more about the lenses used in Formidable.

### Commands

`yarn && yarn start` will install the dependencies and then start the compiler in watch mode. In an other terminal you can start the server `yarn server` to see the example running on [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000).
